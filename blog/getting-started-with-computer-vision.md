# Getting Started with Computer Vision

Computer vision is one of the most exciting fields in artificial intelligence today. Whether you're building object detection systems, facial recognition, or pose estimation models, understanding the fundamentals is crucial.

## Why Computer Vision Matters

In today's world, visual data is everywhere. From autonomous vehicles to medical imaging, computer vision powers some of the most impactful applications of AI.

### Key Applications
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Real-time object detection and scene understanding
- **Medical Imaging**: Disease detection and diagnosis assistance
- **Retail Analytics**: Customer behavior analysis and inventory management
- **Security**: Surveillance and threat detection

## Core Concepts

### Image Representation
Images are represented as matrices of pixel values. Each pixel contains information about color (RGB) or intensity (grayscale).

\`\`\`python
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# Load an image
img = Image.open('image.jpg')
img_array = np.array(img)
print(img_array.shape)  # (height, width, channels)
\`\`\`

### Convolutional Neural Networks

CNNs are the backbone of modern computer vision. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn features from images.

## Getting Started

1. **Learn the Basics**: Start with image processing fundamentals
2. **Understand Deep Learning**: Study neural networks and backpropagation
3. **Explore Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV are essential tools
4. **Build Projects**: Start with simple projects and gradually increase complexity

## Recommended Resources

- **Books**: "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville
- **Courses**: Fast.ai, Stanford CS231n
- **Libraries**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV

## Conclusion

Computer vision is a rapidly evolving field with endless possibilities. Start with the fundamentals, practice consistently, and don't be afraid to experiment with new techniques.
